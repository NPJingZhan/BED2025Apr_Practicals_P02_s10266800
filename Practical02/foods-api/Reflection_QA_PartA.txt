Through the practical and experimenting with postman I learned how to apply CRUD i.e. Create, Read, Update & Delete into my work projetcs 
The challenge I faced was not understanding how to apply the POST part by going to the 'raw' and implementing the required elements

3a. Using POST creates multiple different elements with different IDs whereas PUT updates/changes the information of an element without creating new elements with a different ID which might cause confusion
